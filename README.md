This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code programming puzzles. Advent of Code is an annual event with daily programming challenges released from December 1st to December 25th.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an event created by Eric Wastl, featuring a series of 25 programming puzzles designed to challenge problem-solving skills, coding abilities, and algorithmic thinking. Each day unveils a new puzzle that participants solve using their preferred programming language.
